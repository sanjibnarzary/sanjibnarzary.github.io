**Abstract**
There are 33 consonants, 11 vowels and 17 conjunctive notations in Devanagiri.
The frequency of the uses of these letters in any language using devanagiri
scripts provides information about the morphological structure of the language
in context to uses of letters which finds application in the study of Human
Computer Interaction, Cryptography, Data Compression, Keyboard Design,
Language Processing etc. The method employed in our work based on the
statistics procured systematic monogram, digram and trigram with special
reference to the Bodo language. This statistical data so obtained has been
analysed by using NodeJS Javascript event driven environment. It has been found
that with the monogram identification technique most frequent use consonant
and conjunctive notation letters are among the न र ब स य म ल ग ज द फ ख व थ
and ा िा ा ा ा ा ा ा ा . The letter distribution with bigram and trigram
indicates that the combined letters are mostly used to form a meaningful word
in Bodo, e.g., ल + क + ा + र + ा = लक्र (lokhra) (tiger in English).
