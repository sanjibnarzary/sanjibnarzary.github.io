**Abstract**
For any written language one of the most important entity is writing script. Bodo language uses
Devanagari as one of the official writing scripts for all textbook, letter of communication,
competitive examination etc. There also exists use of Devanagari script in the commercial
newspaper publications like बडसा, इंखं, बडलेण्ड रादाब etc. After surveying various government
repository for Indian Languages like TDIL-DC, CDAC and Google we found no input system exists
for Bodo language. Bodo language uses either Devanagari keyboard or WX Keyboard design for
Hindi. In this paper we present a novel keyboard layout derived from the 104 keyed English
keyboard system specially designed for Bodo language. The new layout when compare in terms
of simplicity of the design and ease of use of keyboard layout with the existing Devanagari
keyboard and WX Keyboard layout for Hindi, we found that for writing Bodo language our
layout provide better satisfaction and performance.
